<p style="color: white;">The Jedi are a fictitious order of warrior monks who play an important role in the 'Star Wars' movie series by George Lucas. They were responsible for the maintenance of peace and order in the Galactic Republic, and were skilled in various mental disciplines from domination to psychokinesis. In addition to these powers, a Jedi novice was expected to construct his or her own lightsaber in order to qualify as a fully-fledged Jedi Knight. 

The Jedi were most likely based on one of the real world's eastern religious traditions. Much of their symbolism has parallels in certain branches of Buddhism. </p>
